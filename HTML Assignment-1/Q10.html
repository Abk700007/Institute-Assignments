<!-- Q10. Create a page titled "Linear Motion Equation":
i. Use the <title> tag to set the webpage's title to "Linear Motion Equation."
ii. Within the body of the page:
• Create a main heading that says: "S = vᵢt + ½at²: The Equation of Linear 
Motion." Use appropriate tags to make this text bold and emphasized.
• Below the heading, insert the following explanation in a paragraph and an 
unordered list that explains each symbol:
The formula S = vᵢt + ½at² describes the motion of an object under constant 
acceleration. Here:
o S represents the displacement,
o vᵢ is the initial velocity,
L3, L4
o t is the time,
o a is the acceleration, and
o ½at² is the additional displacement due to acceleration.
iii. Format the variables "S," "vᵢ," "t," "a," and "½at²" in italics using the appropriate 
HTML tags.
iv. Add the following quote related to motion using proper quotation tags:
"An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force."
Highlight the phrase "external force" by underlining it.
Insert this sentence in the above paragraph. Note: This equation was originally written 
in 1905. -->
